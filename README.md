# Laptop
Laptop is a script to set up your computer for software development. 

It's idempotent and installs, upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed on the machine. In otherwords, there's no downside to running it again and again.

It supports macOS on Apple Silicon.

> Inspired by [Thoughtbot's Laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop), and I hope this inspires you too!

## Getting Started

### Setup your Secrets

Laptop will configure your computer so it can communicate with external services. This requires credentials and other information that should be kept secret. Laptop is configured to retreive these secrets from [1Password](1Password). So you're going to need 1Password for this to work out of the box.

1. Download, install, and login to the [1Password MacOS application].

2. Create a [GitHub Personal Access Token].

2. Unlock 1Password and add a `Login` item called `GitHub` with at least the following `fields`:

    | Type | Label | Example Value | Description |
    | -----| ----- | ------------- | ----------- |
    | text | `name` | John Smith | Full name to be used in Git configuration |
    | text | `email` | john@smith.com | Personal email address to be used in Git configuration |
    | password | `token` | github_pat_asdfjkl | GitHub Personal Access Token to be used with GitHub CLI |
    | text | `username` | jsmith | GitHub username |

3. Generate and save a new [SSH Key in 1Password] with the name `GitHub SSH Key`.

4. Create a [Authentication SSH Key in GitHub] with the public portion of the SSH Key you just added to 1Password.

5. Create a [Signing SSH Key in GitHub] with the public portion of the SSH Key you just added to 1Password.

6. Enable [1Password App Integration] so you can use the 1Password CLI. Check at least the following:

    * ‚úÖ Use the SSH Agent
    * ‚úÖ Integrate with 1Password CLI


### Install Laptop

1. Review the [mac] script. Avoid running a script you haven't read!

2. Run the [mac] script. This will clone the Laptop git project to the directory `~/code/laptop` and setup your computer.

    ```bash
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ssmereka/laptop/main/src/mac | zsh
    ```

3. Close and reopen your terminal so that the updated "~/.zshrc" runs and properly initializes your environment.


### Using Laptop

Laptop installs and configures tools that are used for software development. After running Laptop your machine is ready for development! Laptop also provides some useful commands, in your terminal run `help` to see the list.

```bash
lt-update
```

## What does Laptop do?

Laptop installs and configures your computer for development. Including programming languages, frameworks, and software tools that are common in web and mobile development. The setup is opinionated and iterated upon of years. It's designed to save us time and shared to help set others up for success.

**Languages:**

* [Kotlin]
* [Go]
* [Node.js]
* [Python]
* [Ruby] (and [Ruby on Rails])
* [Rust]

**Software Tools**

* [1Password CLI] for secret management from the commandline.
* [Atuin] for interactive searches of your shell history.
* [AWS CLI] command line interface for interacting with Amazon Web Services.
* [Core Utils] for GNU File, Shell, and Text utilities.
* [Curl] for interacting with URLs from the commandline.
* [Gawk] for interacting with files via the commandline.
* [Git] configures the local mac Git client for use with 1Password and GitHub.
* [GitHub CLI] for interacting with the GitHub API.
* [GnuPG] for encryption and signing.
* [Homebrew] for managing operating system libraries.
* [LibYAML] dependency for reading and writing yaml.
* [Mise] for managing software tools, environments, and automations.
* [NVM] for managing installations of Node.js.
* [OpenSSL] dependency for cryptography.
* [PostgreSQL] Database for storing application information in SQL and JSON.
* [OpenTofu] tool for maintaining infrastructure as code.
* [Visual Studio Code] for a programming IDE.
* [Zsh] configures zsh with some opinions (see the [Zsh Manual]).

Let's look at how some of the software tools are configured.


### ZSH Configuration

Terminal history should persist indefinitely as evidence of the actions you have taken.

Your history is a timeline of actions you have taken that can be leveraged for a number of use-caes. Like recalling what you did to setup an application. Or reviewing actions taken during an outage.

The zsh history is configured to store all (well... 999,999,999) events in the terminal and the `~/.zsh_history` file. With each event containing a timestamp (in seconds since the epoch) and duration (in seconds) of the command. The history is shared across all terminal sessions, as if they were a single session.

If you need to enter secret information into your terminal prefix the command with a `space`, like `" SECRET=my-password"`. Any command the begins with a `space` will not be stored in the history.

Use [Atuin](https://atuin.sh) (using the `Up Arrow` or `CTRL+R`) to interactively view and search your history. Programmatically search with the `history` command, like `history | grep <search term here>`.


### Version Manager

When developing you want your development environment to be as close to production as is reasonable. Switching between mutliple versions of software is complicated. To make switching easier, use version managers and package managers.

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh), mac's unofficial package manager, manages the installation of 3rd party software like `1password` and `curl`.

A language version manager called [Mise] is installed for managing several langugaes, enabling you to quickly switch between versions per project. Sometimes projects have tooling around a specific version manager, like NVM or pyenv. While Mise is configured as the default, you can still use other version managers. For example NVM is also installed and you can switch to the NVM managed node version with the `nvm use` command.


### Code Directory

Coding projects from git repositories are stored in the local `~/code` directory. We recommend using the pattern `~/code/<organization-name>/<repository-name>` so `<organization-name>` and `<repository-name>` align with GitHub. For example `~/code/ssmereka/laptop`. We find having code all in one root level folder makes it easier to work in an IDE or terminal. While a namespacing that mirrors GitHub makes it easy to find the right project and prevents naming collisions.


### Secrets

Secrets should be encrypted while at rest **and** you should authorize when anything tries to access those secrets. Laptop will install and configure the 1Password CLI so that secrets can be retrieved programmatically. With 1Password prompting you for authorization when anything attempts to access them. Laptop also configures Git to pull credentials from 1Password for authentication and signing. You can extend this to support multiple accounts.


## Customize Laptop

Laptop creates a folder to store all the configuration files it manages. By default this is in the user's home directory at path `~/.config/laptop`. These files are then semantically linked to the appropriate locations as required by the various software tools. You can modified these files as needed to customize your individual setup. Subsequent runs of Laptop will never modifiy these files without confirmation or an override command like `-f` or `--force`.

Additional files can be added to extend some of the existing configurations. For example, you may want to extend the configuartions for multiple accounts or for internal tools.

You can add the following files to the `~/.config/laptop` directory:

* `.zshrc_*` - Files with the `.zshrc_` prefix will be added to the end of the `.zshrc` file and loaded in each session.


* `.custom_install.sh` - Script that will be run at the end of the Laptop `install`.


### Custom Install Script

You can extend the Laptop script with your own script(s). Adding a `zsh` script at path `~/.laptop/custom_install.sh` and Laptop will automatically run this script after setup. You might add a custom script to install internal tools or to have different setups per machine. Make sure your custom script(s) are idempotent and have the correct permissions to run. Laptop will never modify custom scripts or anything in the `~/.laptop` directory. 

Here's a `~/.laptop/.custom_install.sh` example:

```zsh
#!/bin/zsh

brew bundle --file=- <<EOF
brew "ngrok"
EOF
```
